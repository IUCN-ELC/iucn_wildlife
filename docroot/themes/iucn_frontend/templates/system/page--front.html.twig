 * - is_admin: A flag indicating if the user has permission to access
 *   administration pages.

 *   linking to the front page. This includes the language domain or prefix.

 * - site_name: The name of the site. This is empty when displaying the site
 *   name has been disabled in the theme settings.

 *   slogan has been disabled in theme settings.

 *   displayed after the main title tag that appears in the template.

 *   administration interface.
 * - node: Fully loaded node, if there is an automatically-loaded node
 *   associated with the page and the node ID is the second argument in the
 *   page's path (e.g. node/12345 and node/12345/revisions, but not
 *   comment/reply/12345).
